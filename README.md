# PunyLisp

This is my take on the Make-A-Lisp process (https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md see here).
The repository provides a lisp interpreter written in Kotlin.
The name is an apt assessment of the interpreter performance (hopefully to be improved in the future). 
As of now, I am at step 6 of the process.

## Features

*  expressions
* if, do, let, def, lambda special forms
* IO (print+read)
* boolean, integer,double and string literals
* tail call recursion

## To-be-implemented
* quoting
* proper exception handling
* macros
* jvm interop support
* (ao/ji)t compilation (?)
